I am a brilliant Senior Tech Writer and Content Manager with more than 20 years of experience. I have written in everything from Microsoft Word to Madcap Flare to Markdown and Asciidoc. 

I have worked in software and hardware, documenting SaaS PLM systems, APIs and SDKs, even virtual reality experiences and helmets. I have worked as a solo writer owning the entire doc function and I have worked as part of a larger team. I have been 100% remote (playing my records and annoying my pets), and I have been in the office full-time, eyeing the snacks.

Accessiblity and inclusive language are important to me. I write succinctly and communicate well. Expectations? I occasionally exceed them.
